 NOTES:
 
		***Processing*** SQL Statements with JDBC.
		#1.	Establishing a connection.
		
				First, establish a connection with the data source you want to use. A data source can be a DBMS,
				a legacy file system, or some other source of data with a corresponding JDBC driver. This connection
				is represented by a connection object.
				
				CREATING statements: a statement is an interface that represent a SQL statement. You execute Statement
				objects, and they generate ResultSet objects, which is a table of data representing a database result set. You
				need a Connection object to create a Statement object.
				
				 For e.g. , CoffeesTable.viewTable creates a Statement object with the following code: 
				 	stmt = con.createStatement();
		>> There are 3 types of statements:
			*	Statement: Used to implement  simple SQL Statements
				
		#2.	Create a statement.
		
		#3.	Execute the query.
		#4.	Process the ResultSet object.
		#5.	Close the connection.
