 * @topic : Gherkins language. 
 * @definition : 
 * @tags :	<theory> <framework>
 *
 * @note:	tips to remember:
 *			* Maven gives you the ready made project skeleton to work with for every kind of project. 
 *			* Here you can manage your build as well, but Maven is called build management tool for some
 *			  some reason. So, use the maven's auto-generated maven project directories.
 *			* maven has a tag called <scope> which defines scope of dependencies in project.

 ******** Begin *******
  Points to remember: 
 !1	Gherkins language can be installed as plugin in eclipse.
 !2	cucumber cannot understand any project directory structure in should be in a proper directory 
	structure which you need to define in order for cucumber to understand and run the test cases from.
	Maven can actually help in obtaining a cucumber project structure that can be used. 
 !3 Maven artifactId = "maven-archtype-quickstart" is the template which cucumber supports, so use that 
 	template.
 !4 Concept of feature file is used in cucumber Automation and we will automate this file only.
 	And we also need step-definition file. all the scenarios are defined in step-definition. This is
 	to automate the plain English file. and Third thing is test runner this runs all the test case 
 	
 
 ********
 NOTES:
 	Understanding cucumber dependencies:
 	> common dependencies used to run cucumber are:
 	> cucumber- java.
 	> cucumber- j-unit.
 	> j-unit itself.
	
 
  EFFECTIVE E.G. :
  
  Scenario #1:
	So, when we define step-definition files to map the automation code to feature file. Suppose for scenario
	where given land on landing page, When i click on the sign-in button( this is a scenario ). When you define 
	a step definition file you will write an automation code to tie up the code to this line. 
	
  Scenario #1.
