	// Extent Report and Extent Spark Reporter
	> now Extent Spark Reporter is a helper class which will configure every thing to main class.
	> Extent Report and this main class is responsible for every test run we can do.
	> call attach Reporter() to attach the reporter and call setSystemInfo() to set all the system info.
	> we need to set the report configuration with @befortest annotation as the configuration will required 
		during the test.
	> we need to call createTest() and connect the test to the report. This method monitors test 
		and to end the test call flush() so report won't monitor your test.
		we need to always write all this code we can create a TestNG utility to drive all this code.
	> Report generation will happen after the test.
	> ExtentTest test = extent.createTest("intial Demo"); now this test object wil get the created test values and listen to 
		the test and feed back to the extent Report. using this tool you can do allot of thing like addScreenCapture or purposefully fail
		 etc.
