> Jenkins is a continous integration tools to automate the daily routine tools
	and one of the most important in software industry.
>	Scenario where you have 500 test case with you and you have to trigger them through command.
	 we need something to automate them as well, we need Jenkins. we need to run all our test cases at 
	 2 AM daily then your 7 hour test could trigger at the specified time.
>	In development one will regression job and one will be smoke job.  For non-technical business folks 
	they just need to know you jenkins Url and see the test runs. Jenkins runs on its own server and it maintains 
	consistency and runs every time on given setting.
>	 download jenkins.

> DevOps guys will take care for you and you need not worry about this as they will host jenkins for 
	particular server. 
> Maven has an excellent compatiblity with CI tools called Jenkins.
>	If you want to run you project either use Github or place project in Jenkins home directory.
>	When you create Jenkins Job either you give Source code Management. 

>	after creating a new Job for Maven and setting up.
>	Invoke top-level Maven targets
	Maven version: apache-maven-x.x.x
	Goals: 	clean
				compile

> Test NG reports are provided by sure-fire plugin which gives an index.hrml code.
> so TestNG provides a plugin which can give test reports using Jenkins using testing results 
	xml file in test-output of maven sure-fire.
>	go to workspace > configure > post_build-Action as you need to generate the report after the test is complete
> build periodically is set using M H Month Day DayOfWeek
	hence, 0 7 * * * is run every day at 7 AM.
	<Theory> jenkins Scheduling Jenkins Job for specific time.
> Smoke regression people can see it.
