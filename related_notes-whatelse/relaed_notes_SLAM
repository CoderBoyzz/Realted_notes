 @TOPIC:	SLAM-R Algorithm of Simultanous Localization and Mapping using RFID for Obstacle 
 			and Recognition.

 @PREFACE:	This paper presents an algorithm of simultanous localization and mapping (SLAM)
 			with a scanning laser range finder and radiofrequency identification technology
 			(RFID) to include landmarks of an object or place within a generated map. For the 
 			testing phase was used of simulation software Anykode's Marilou and was used to build 
 			a virtual Mobile robot with the features of the Pionner 3-AT, including a Hakuyo URG-04X
 			scanning laser finder and an innovations RFID ID-12 reader. Validation of results was 
 			carried out with the cycle closure process to obtain the average error of the navigation 
 			path, resulting on an error of less than 50mm.

  POINTS TO NOTE: 

	1. Introduction:
			For decades, researh has focused on attempting to simulte common human actions like 
			walking, running, talking and even thinking. One of the qualities of humans that has 
			gathered the most attention from scientists is their ability to move around in difference
			settings, making researcher focus on navigation techniques that transfer this ability to 
			artificial entities. In 1986, Peter Cheeseman, Jim Crowley and Hugh Durrant-Whyte talked 
			about the topic of simultanous localization and mapping applying probability SLAM, during 
			IEEE robotic conference.

			The creation of SLAM resulted in various research the tried to determine which action would 
			be carried out first, localization and mapping. Multiple algorithms allowing for the simultanous
			navigation and localization (SLAM) of mobile robots have been developed since then, both are
			indoor and outdoor environments.

	2.	Algorithms: 
			Algorithm ***GMapping*** is a particle filter-based online algorithm wiht Rao-Blackwellization 
			proposing the distribution of probabilities that consider the last measure taken by the laser 
			device, and not just **odometry**. This is done by searching the region closer to the estimated
			location. defining the probability of each landmark associated to the measure and adding the 
			odometry information; from this, K samples are extracted to estimate a Guassian distribution
			matching the mean and variance wiht the estimated distribution. The particle's new position is
			obtained form teh resulting distribution. Before resampling, a measure inversely proportional 
			to the variance of particle's estimations is calculated to assess the need of resampling. This 
			algorithm from intel, Freiburg and MIT, with good results, generating maps without inconsistencies 
			for eahc tested data, including analysis form different researchers. One of the setbacks of the 
			algorithm is dynamic objects, as well as objects with complex modeling grass, wires etc.

			The **Kalman** filter-based algorithm **CEKF-SLA** maps using environment features: it also optimizes 
			algorithm EKF-SLAM by using a compressed filter, which delays updates of convarience[meaning],
			associated to a set of non-local labels. This increases the algorithm's efficiency without 
			diminishing the accuracy that characterizes full SLAM algorithms. This algorithms was tested 
			outdoors using a car with encoders and a laser telemeter that followed a path during 20minutes.
			Results were favorable and demonstrated the optimization of the original algorithm: however, the 
			problem of cycle closure in maps still persists.
