 * @topic : jasmine framework
 * @definition : Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing 
 * 				JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. 
 * 				It does not require a DOM.
 * @tags :	<THEORY> <PRACTICE>
 *
 * @note: Every Spec in Jasmine should define Describe and it blocks.

 ******** Begin *******
  Points to remember: 
 !1	Two terminologies "Describe" and "it".
 	In lamen terms **Describe** defines test suite. Test suite (A folder where all the
 	the test folder which holds all the related test cases in it.)
 	**It** here stands for JavaScript test cases which lies inside a test suite. A javaScript test file
 	is called Spec(As per the jasmine terminology) but is test file.  
 	
 !2 you will  run testcase from Spec level and like you can do with java and testNG but what you 
 	can do but what you can do is write an Configuration file.
 	 
 !3 configuration file can run by setting a new run configuration in eclipse and then giving path to
  	protractor main file (cli.js) 
 
 ********
 NOTES:
 	So the Acutal heirarchy is one Describe(Test suite/test folder) contains all Spec(test files)
 	and the spec contain all the It(test cases). but real implementation is little different from 
 	this.
 	
 	Test Runner in JavaScript(Protractor):
 	
 
  EFFECTIVE E.G. :
  
  Scenario #1.
  	>	suppose you have 6 spec files you can include all the names of all the sepc files 
  		into the Configuration file and run your test cases from there. Just like TestNG
  		have testng.xml file.	
  Scenario #1.

 ###SYSTAX TO REMEMBER###
 
 	IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 	//not auto generated stub.
 	
 	describe("this is a test suite", function() {
 		var a;
 		
 		it("", function() {
 			a = true;
 			
 			expected(a).toBe(true);
 		});
 	});
 	
 	>>>Syntax of conf.js:
 	
 	exports.config = {
	seleniumAddress: 'htttp://localhost:4444/wd/hub',
	specs: ['WebContent/spec1.js'], //specs or test files
};
 	IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 
 NOTES on Syntax:
 
 	//describe function is a test suite here takes two arguments
 	(one is the massage or name of test suite(Stirng) and second argument it takes 
 	is the function() which describes all the test cases in it blocks.)
 	
 	//spec runs all the test files and those test files needs to be executed by running
 	the conf.js file using some sort of test runner.

 ###CODE TO REMEMBER###

 	//not auto generated stub.
 	
 	describe("Protractor test suite", function(){
	var a;
	
	it("Open Angular js website", function() {
		browser.get("https://angularJS.org");
		
		element(by.node1("todolist.toDoList")).sendkeys("Written something using Protractor automation");
		
		// what ever code you write you write it here. 
	});
	
	it("payment in angular website", function() {
		
		// another test case.
	})
	});
