 * @topic : What is Protractor?
 * @definition : Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS
 *             application. generally, (WebDriver + Angular Support = Protractor.)
 * @tags :  <theory> <practice>
 *
 * @note:  Disclaimer: but Protractor makes your life easy. 
 * 			If something changes in the future you should be ready. So, make a habit of reading the 
 * 			official websites.
 * 			To know the version of node-module type : "node-module --version"
 * 			If you see tests are failing in protractor is failing after latest release 
 * 			then you should updata the webdriver-manager by typing: "webdriver-manager update"

  POINTS TO NOTE: 

	1. Selenium WebDriver can be used to automate Angualar Apps but there are some Angualar features
		Which may or may not be handled by WebDriver. Or WebDriver is little inconsistent with little core
		features of Angular Application. 
		Also, somehow to make those features work you need to do alot of coding using selenium WebDriver.

	2. WHAT IS JASMINE?
		Jasmine is unit testing framework for e.g. In Selenium you might have come accross the unit testing 
		Frameworks like TestNG. Junit. Its same but for JavaScript/Protractor.
		Jasmine is an open-source testing framework for JavaScript. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled 
		platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax.

	3. ### NOTES ON NODE.JS ###
 
		Q. What Node.js? 
		A. chorme v8 js engine topped with c++.

		Q. What is npm?
		A. npm stands for node package manager. It is used to install software which are
			available in node repository. Protractor is hosted in node repository.

	4. 	Points: you will need Selenium-server to connect your protractor test cases to your 
		actual browser. Its basically like selenuim Grid or appium. 

	5. 	The server needs to be started in order to start any testing with protractor. Your protractor
		code will send a request to the server which control your local browser accordingly. 
 
 ^.^ GO THOROUGH POINTS ^.^
	=>  Understand the importance of Protractor.
	=>	Learn Protractor (Angular Automation Tool) from Scratch.
	=>	JavaScript(TypeScript is optional) as the core language to make Protractor applications.
	=>	Demand of Protractor is increasing cuz the use of frameworks like angualr.js and vue.js are Also 
		increasing.

 ### FIGURATIVE STUDY ###
  
 	IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
		### DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TYPESCRIPT AND JAVASCRIPT ###
		1. TypeScript is not a new language.
		2. it is superset of JavaScript.
		3. JavaScript + Few Additional features (OOPS)	= TypeScript.
		4. No matter you use JS or TS, Protractor API Remains same in syntaxes and is originally 
			built in JS. Differences arises in syntaxs when building the Test framework for Protractor.
		5. 2 different Framework Jasmine(JavaScript) and Cuccumber(TypeScript).
		
		NOTES on The Differences:
		> 	oops concept in JS is fairly new and brought in during ES5 release.]
		>	But the concept of oops are still lacking in JS which are more visible in TypeScript.
		> 	The Protractor API syntax is same for TS and JS. For e.g. clicking a button or sending 
			the keys all are same for TS and JS.
		>	When you start building a framework then you are going to see alot of changes in TS and JS.
			for e.g. when you use PO pattern to drive data from one page to another page.

 ### REALTED SYTAX/CODES ###
 
 	IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 	//@noSyntax
 	IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
 	// codes related npm and webdriver-manager

	 Server can be started by typing: "webdriver-manager start"

	 Server will start with in port no. localhost:4444/

	 Output:		
 	 01:04:06.875 INFO [SeleniumServer.boot] - Selenium Server is up and running on port 4444

 closure:
	At the end we finally found answers for the questions like.
	Q.	Why Protractor? 
		-The only stable framework to Automate Angular Apps. It is developed and maintained by Angular Team.
		***Selenium*** is still king but for Angular Apps Protractor takes the edge. For all the cutting edge 
		Technologies like React.js, Angular.js and Vue.js for all of this ***Protractor*** is very stable.
		and is by default supports all the angular apps as developed by the same devs.

	Q. What language does Protractor Support?
		-Protractor is a Node.js program built on top of WebDriverJS. So it uses JavaScript as core language 
		to develop tests. So, core Protractor is Selenium WebDriver for JS and top of it they used some wrapper 
		classes to support angular apps. And as with selenium those wrapper classes are not compulsory but then it
		would take alot of years to get through simple things which could be done in minutes. That's why you use 
		JavaScript(TypeScript is optional) as the core language to make Protractor applications.

	Q. Why Protractor have huge demand in the market?
		-I do not have JavaScript knowledege. Can I follow this Tutorial? Absolutely. Everthing from Scratch.

	Q. Even if your Application becomes non Angular somehow even then Protractor supports non-angular Apps
		As well. 

	Q. What are the tools/languages are used to automate angualar Apps?
		-Node.js, Jasmine, JavaScript and Protractor API.
